Vt, version 3.01
Windows PE
Compiled with Borland C++ compiler (whichever one was copyright 1998)

vt.exe is the program used to create vol archives.
It can add files to existing archives, but cannot modify files already in archives
Supports two (three?) types of compression. Different files can be compressed using different methods in the same archive
Works well in wine
Can put multiple files of the same name in a vol

Usage: vt [options] volume [@]file

options:
	-sp						strips path when inserting file into vol
	-lzh        			set compression type to LZH (lempel-ziv huffman)
	-rle        			set compression type to RLE (run-length encoding)
							This seems to be the default
	-cpt        			compact the volume into a new volume named file.
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
							(if volume doesn't exist, it's automatically created, so I guess this is for making compression consistent?)
	-nobpm      			don't convert .dib's or .bmp's into phoenix bitmaps.
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
    -q      		 		quiet mode
    -lz 		     		(undocumented) set compression type to LZ (lempel-ziv)
    						Appears to work, then crashes on use.
 	-dml[#bmp_path]			adds bitmaps from dml file into volume
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
 	-mip[#n[#pallete_file]]	invokes MIPMAKE to mip the bmp
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
 	-r(min,max)				set mipmap pallete range(s) restrictions
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
	-s       				(undocumented) unknown, obsolete
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
          					There is code to print "vt: \"-s\" option is obsolete, ignoring\n" to stdout present
 	-n  		   			(undocumented) unknown, obsolete
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
	          				There is code to print "vt: \"-n\" option is obsolete, ignoring\n" to stdout present
	[@]                     @ symbol before addfile implies addfile is a script file of args to pas to vt (omit volume on all lines)
							Haven't looked into this one much yet
